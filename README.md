# Design Bursts

**When?**
These are currently running on Wednesdays mornings before the start of the week's project for the duration of FAC14, weeks 1-8 in London.

**What?**
Half hour workshops/presentations every week to learn a little about one aspect of design, which can then be built on and included in that weeks project. 

**Why?**
This idea came about as a result of the feedback we got time and time again from students after going through Design Week. Whilst design week is concentrated more on understanding the problem we are trying to solve with technology and learn about user centred approaches, students felt that they would love to also be taught some basic UX/UI concepts.

We think that by introducing little design snippets throughout we can ensure that students have a better understanding and appreciation of design, be better prepared to Design Week, make a the projects better for their portfolios and also understand deeply the meaning of working in a multidisciplinary team when they are out in the job market. 

**How?**
@nogainbar and @maxgerber are creating presentations for each week which they are delivering on Wednesdays just before projects start. 


Please give us any feedback on this idea, and help us improve it! If it all goes well, we can think about adding it to the coursebook. ðŸ˜„ ðŸŽ‰
